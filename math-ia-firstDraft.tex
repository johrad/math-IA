                Coffee has become an integral part of many lives, including mine. It's what wakes you up in the morning and sustains your energy-levels throughout the day. The leading chemical stimulant in coffee is called caffeine and it's classified as a "Psychoactive drug", meaning that it alters the chemical processes that goes on in your brain. The main effect of caffeine is to alter the brain's perception of when it's tired, and is the reason why I and many others admire this mild drug. And since the world average amount of sleep lies bellow the hourly optimum, it is no wonder why caffeine consumed to such extents as it is today.
